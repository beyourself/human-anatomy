part 1 the shoulder 2.0 muscle(02)

muscle passing from trunk to scapula 

now it's time to look at the muscles which hold the scapula in place,and move it in relation to the trunk. there are six of them,four on the back,one in the front, and one underneath.

1 underneath 下面

the one on the underneath is the large and powerful serratus anterior muscle. this is just part of it. to see it all, we need to move the scapula away from the body. this big expanse of muscle is all serratus anterior. it arises from the side and front of the first eight ribs.it runs back under the scapula, and it's inserted all the way back here, along the medial border of the scapula.

3 expanse 广阔区域

when the whole  serratus anterior muscle contracts, it pull the scapula forward around the rib cage:that's protrusion. when its upper,or lower fibers contract separately, they help to produce downward, or upward rotation of the scapula.

now let's look at those four muscles on the back. one,the trapezius is large and superficial,teh other three are small and deep. the three deep ones are levator scapulae, and the two rhomboids, rhomboid minor, and rhomboid major.

levator scapulae arises here, on the outermost point of the first three cervical vertebrae. it inserts here, on the upper medial corner of the scapula. levator scapulae helps to elevate the scapula.the rhomboids arise here, from the fourth cervical to the fifth thoracic vertebrae. they insert here, along the medial border of the scapula.

the rhombiods elevate and retract the scapula. the large muscle which overlies these three is the trapezius. it's a beautiful but complicated muscle. the trapezius has an upper part, and a lower part, which both converge on the spine of the scapula.

the upper part of trapezius arises from the occiput, and from the nuchal ligament,and from T1 to T3 in the mid-line. it's inserted along the upper edge of the spine oof the scapula, around the acromion ,and along the lateral third of the clavicle.

the lower part of the trapezius muscle is not so massive. it arises form T4 to T12 in the mid-line. it inserts here, on the lower edge of the this part of the spine of the scapula. when the whole of trapezius contracts, it powerfully retracts the scapula.whenthe upper part contracts, it powerfully elevates the scapula.

last on the list of muscles passing from the trunk to the scapula is the one on the front. it's pectorails minor. pectoralis minor arises between the second and the fourth ribs. it's inserted on the corracoid process . pectoralis minor produces depression oof the  scapula.

there are two very small muscles to mention just for completeness. one is subclavius which goes from the first rib to the clavicle. its function is uncertain. the other is omohyoid. which arises from the hyoid bone way up here, and inserts over here, on the upper edge of the spine of the scapula. its function is to depress the hyoid bone and the larynx.
