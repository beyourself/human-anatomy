part 1 the shoulder 2.0

as we've seen,the medial end of the clavicle articulates with the sternum at the sterno-clavicular joint.strong ligaments between the clavicle and the sternum and between the clavicle and the underlying first rib,keep the two bones together but permit an impressive range of motion:up and down,and backward and forward.

now let's see how the clavicle and the scapula move,relative to the trunk. upward movement of the scapula is called elevation;downward movement is called depression. forward movement around the trunk is called protraction;the opposite movement is retracion. this movement is called upward rotation. the opposite movement is downward rotation-in real lift these movements of the scapula are often combined.

the range of motion of the scapula porveides fully one third of the total range of motion of the humerus,relative to the body,sometimes more.without this movement of the scapula,we'd only be able to abduct our arm to here. that'as far as the shoulder joint goes, before bone hits bone.it's scapular movement that lets us get all the way to here.

now let's look at the shoulder joint. to understand the shoulder joint, let's get acquainted with the upper half of the humerus.

this is the head of the humerus. the articular surface is half of a sphere. on the anterior aspect is a well marked groove known as the bicipital groove, because the tendon of the long head of biceps runs in it. at the proximal end of the groove are the lesser tubercle, and the greater tubercle. because it's between two tubercles,the bicipital groove is also known as inter-tubercular groove. down here on the lateral aspect of the humerus, almost halfway down the bone, is a rough spot, the deltoid tubersosity.

here's the shoulder joint, also known as the gleno-humeral joint. this loose sleeve of tissue which encloses the joint the joint capsule.the capsule doesn't hold the bones together, it's quite a weak structure.what it does is to permit movement. the structures which hold the two bones together are muscles,as we'll see . here's the tendon of one of those muscles.

let's look at the movements that can occur at the shoulder joint. movement forward and upward is called flexion. movement downward and backward is called extension. movement away form the side of the body is ab-duction. the opposite movement is ad-duction. rotation which moves the front of the arm towards the body, is internal rotation. rotation the other way is external rotation.

now that we've taken a look at the bones. joints and ligaments, let's spend about a minute reviewing what we've seen so far.
